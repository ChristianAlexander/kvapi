# KV API

Store and retrieve values. An exploration into Auth0.

## Purpose

I wanted to learn how Auth0 works, and needed a simple project that requires auth and user-scoped data storage/retrieval. This was the simplest project to accomplish this task.

## Notice

This project uses in-memory storage, and should not be used for any real-life purposes.
